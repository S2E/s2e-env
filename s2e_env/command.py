class BaseCommand(object):
    """
    The base class that all commands ultimately derive from.

    This class is based on Django's ``BaseCommand`` class. The normal flow
    works as follows:

    1. ``manage.py`` loads the command class and calls its ``run_from_argv()``
       method.

    2.  The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get an
        ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them and then calls the
        ``execute()`` method, passing the parsed arguments.

    3. The ``execute`` method attemps to carry out the command by calling the
       ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments.

    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raises an exception (e.g.
       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will instead print an error
       message to ``stderr``.

    Thus, the ``handle`` method is typically the starting point for subclasses;
    many built-in commands either place all of their logic in ``handle()``, or
    perform some additional parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from
    it to more specialized methods as needed. The handle method can return a
    string that will be printed on sucessful completion of the command.

    If a subclass requires additional arguments and options, these should be
    implemented in the ``add_arguments()`` method. For specifying a short
    description of the command, which will be printed in help messages, the
    ``help`` class attribute should be specified.
